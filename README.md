[TL;DR](http://krakendev.io/blog/generating-warnings-in-xcode)  

This script will let you create warnings and errors manually.   
Usage :  
```
// TODO: This will generate a warning and highlight this line.  
// FIXME: Same as above.  
// ERROR: This will generate an error and will prevent you from building the project.  
```
